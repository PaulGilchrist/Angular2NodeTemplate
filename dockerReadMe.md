    ::Create a temporary folder and copy in all the files needed for the new container  
    md %containerFolder%  
    xcopy "c:\program files\nodejs\*.*" %containerFolder%\nodejs\*.* /s  
    copy Dockerfile %containerFolder%\  
    :: Build the new container  
    docker build -t node:latest %containerFolder%  
    :: Cleanup the temporary folder
